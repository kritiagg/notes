# Classification Tree
- classification tree ask a series of questions to answer a problem. It comes up with the values of all the features and then
asks a series of questions on them to classify the points.
- Since the set of splitting rules used to segment the
predictor space can be summarized in a tree, these types of
approaches are known as decision-tree methods.
- Tree based approaches are simple but they are not as good as the state of the art approaches. Hence we have approaches like Bagging, 
Boosting and random forests which use consensus of many trees to arrive at a solution.
- The idea of creating a decision tree is to divide the overall region into regions according to set of inequalities between the
features and their values.
- Its impossible to consider all the splits, hence we use a greedy strategy to split the tree at each time, so as to take the best decision
at the current step using the split that reduces the MSE by the maximum. 

- But these methods can lead to overfitting as they can fir even the noise in the data
- Hence, we do tree pruning.
